Hello, world!

This is my first post on my built-in blog using markdown. The building process itself was a bit challenging, but I learned a lot from this project.

I learned to:
- Use markdown to write blog posts and process it using Next.js [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), [`chakra-ui-markdown-renderer`](https://github.com/mustaphaturhan/chakra-ui-markdown-renderer) and  using [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) to highlight code snippets on some of my blog entries (with help of internet, of course ðŸ˜ƒ)
- Create a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy my website to GitHub Pages (a lot of failures happened, but I learned a lot from this)

Actually I was planning to use MongoDB Data API to get data from database, but it seems that there is CORS problem with it and I couldn't get it to work. Seems like I should create my own API, then.

Time to put some markdown notes from past here, I guess.
