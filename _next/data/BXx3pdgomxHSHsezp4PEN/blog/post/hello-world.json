{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Hello, world!","date":"2020-08-12","slug":"hello-world","content":"\r\nHello, world!\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on my built-in blog using markdown. The building process itself was a bit challenging, but I learned a lot from this project.\r\n\r\nI learned to:\r\n- Use markdown to write blog posts and process it using Next.js [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), [`chakra-ui-markdown-renderer`](https://github.com/mustaphaturhan/chakra-ui-markdown-renderer) and  using [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) to highlight code snippets on some of my blog entries (with help of internet, of course ðŸ˜ƒ)\r\n- Create a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy my website to GitHub Pages (a lot of failures happened, but I learned a lot from this)\r\n\r\nActually I was planning to use MongoDB Data API to get data from database, but it seems that there is CORS problem with it and I couldn't get it to work. Seems like I should create my own API, then.\r\n\r\nTime to put some markdown notes from past here, I guess."}},"__N_SSG":true}
